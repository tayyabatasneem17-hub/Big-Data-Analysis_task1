# Big-Data-Analysis_task1

COMPANY: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS
NAME: TAYYABA TASNEEM
INTERN ID: CT04DY1443
DOMAIN: DATA ANALYSIS
DURATION: 4 WEEKS
MENTOR: [NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR]
Task Description
As part of the CODTECH Data Analysis Internship – Task 1, I performed Big Data Analysis using PySpark. The objective was to simulate a large-scale taxi rides dataset, perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate visualizations to identify trends and patterns in ride data.
The dataset consists of:
tpep_pickup_datetime → Date and time of taxi pickup
passenger_count → Number of passengers per trip
trip_distance → Distance traveled in miles
fare_amount → Fare charged for the trip
The synthetic dataset contained 100,000 rows to mimic large real-world datasets encountered in urban transportation analytics.

What I Performed in the Task

The project followed a structured Big Data Analysis workflow:

1. Dataset Creation

Generated a synthetic taxi rides dataset with realistic variance in passenger count, trip distance, fare amount, and seasonal pickup trends.
Introduced higher ride volumes during peak months to simulate busiest periods.


2. Data Cleaning

Removed invalid entries such as trips with zero or negative distances or fares.
Ensured all columns had proper data types for analysis.


3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated average fare by passenger count to understand fare distribution.
Identified top 5 busiest pickup months to simulate demand patterns.
Extracted top 5 longest trips by distance to observe outliers or extreme values.


4. Data Visualization

Created bar charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

1. Average fare per passenger count
2. Top 5 busiest months by number of pickups
3. Top 5 longest trips by distance


Saved all charts as PNG images for reporting and presentations.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python 3.x → Main programming language

PySpark → Large-scale data processing and analysis

Pandas → Conversion of PySpark DataFrames for plotting

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Visualization of analytical results

NumPy → For numerical computations

Editor/Platform Used
Google Colab as a primary editor
The project can also run in VS Code and Jupyter Notebook.

Real-Life Applications

This taxi dataset analysis demonstrates real-world applications in:

1. Urban Transportation Planning
Identifying peak months and times for ride demand.
Informing cab dispatch, traffic management, and city planning.


2. Fare Analysis & Optimization
Understanding fare distribution for trips with different passenger counts.
Assisting taxi companies in pricing strategies.


3. Business Intelligence & Reporting
Generating automated charts and dashboards for transportation analytics.


4. Data-Driven Decision Making
Using insights to optimize fleet utilization and operational efficiency.

Note: This task showcases the workflow of creating synthetic datasets, cleaning data, performing analysis, and generating visualizations using PySpark and Python, which are crucial skills in data analysis and business intelligence.
